// C cheat sheet

// To get maximum without if/else
- maxi(x,y) -> return ((x+y) + abs(x-y))/2;

- Bit position 0 if 1 -> number is odd; 0-> number is even

- Lower order n bits are 0 -> divisibe by 2 power n 

- 1 in bit position n, 0 every where else, so number is 2 power n

- Bits n-1,...0 are 1, all other bits are 0 -> num = (2 power n) - 1

unsigned numbers:
shift left by 1 -> multiplication by 2 (mul by (2 power n))
shift right by 1 -> integer division by 2 (div by (2 power n))
