a. steps to board bring up i2c devices on yocto/linux SoC:
1. Device tree settings 
2. Hardware connections/measurements with oscillscope to check all the signals
3. i2c tools linux (to access the slaves)

b. steps to board bring up spi devices on yocto/linux SoC:
1. Device tree settings 
2. Hardware connections/measurements with oscillscope to check all the signals
3. Spi dev test (to acesses the slaves)
