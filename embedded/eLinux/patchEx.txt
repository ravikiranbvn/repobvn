Patching files using git 
1. example git: https://github.com/Xilinx/embeddedsw/tree/master

2. git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/embeddedsw/tree/master

3. git checkout master-rel-2020.2

4. lets suppose file xrfdc.h has to be patched
  --> then copy xrfdc_h_modified.h (with necessary changes) to location XilinxProcessorIPLib/drivers/rfdc/src

5. the do a git diff with a commit id/branch
   Ex: git diff 08b9f43:./xrfdc_h.h xrfdc_h_modified.h > exChanges.patch

6. exChanges.patch is the patch file to add in yocto projects under files section
